# Decisions

Append-only log. Newest entries go at the bottom. Each decision is dated and
states the choice and its rationale. Do not rewrite history here; supersede an
old decision with a new entry that references it.

## D1 — Single `main` branch + cross-JDK CI matrix (no JDK-line branches)
**Date:** 2026-06-13

Source verification confirmed `Thinlet.java` uses no `sun.*` APIs, no
`setAccessible`, and no JDK-internal access. A Java-8-targeted JAR therefore
runs unmodified on JDK 8–25. We keep a single `main` branch and prove cross-JDK
behavior with a CI matrix (JDK 8 / 11 / 17 / 21 / 25), not with per-JDK
branches.

## D2 — Divergence playbook (escape hatch, expected unused)
**Date:** 2026-06-13

If a future JDK removes/changes something Thinlet needs *and* the fix cannot be
expressed in Java-8-compatible source, cut branch `java-N` from `main`, record
the trigger here, disable linear-history protection on that branch so it can
receive forward-merges from `main`, and suffix its artifacts `-javaN`. The main
matrix gains a `java-N` column for that JDK row. Expected to remain unused.

## D3 — Attribution discipline
**Date:** 2026-06-13

README opens with credit to Robert Bajzat and links to the original SourceForge
site. The LGPL 2.1 `LICENSE` and the copyright headers in the source files are
preserved verbatim; **no fresh nomixer copyright is claimed** on top of the
original. `AUTHORS` lists Bajzat as original author and the maintainer
separately as "modernization-fork maintainer."

Note: the 2005 archive shipped no plain-text license file — only the LGPL
header notice in the sources plus an *abbreviated* `docs/lgpl.html` (TERMS
0–16, missing the Preamble and the "How to Apply" appendix). `LICENSE` is the
**complete canonical LGPL 2.1** text the source header invokes; the archive's
abbreviated `docs/lgpl.html` is preserved verbatim as the historical artifact.

## D4 — GitHub Packages publication + authentication note
**Date:** 2026-06-13

Publication target is **GitHub Packages only** (not Maven Central).
**Only `thinlet-core` publishes**; `thinlet-demos` and `thinlet-drafts` are
reactor modules (built, tested, CI-gated) with
`<maven.deploy.skip>true</maven.deploy.skip>`. GitHub Packages requires
authentication **even for public reads**, so consumers (including the
consumer-compat CI job and the future Thing project) need a token. The README
documents this.

## D5 — `--release 8` deprecation hedge
**Date:** 2026-06-13

Build JVM is a modern LTS (JDK 21); javac targets Java 8 bytecode via
`--release 8`; surefire runs tests on a real JDK 8 via `maven-toolchains-plugin`.
`--release 8` is deprecated and will eventually be dropped from a future javac.
When that happens, pin an older build JDK or switch to a toolchains-driven
javac 8. Tracked as an open item.

## D6 — `AppletLauncher` lives in `thinlet-demos`, not `thinlet-core`
**Date:** 2026-06-13

Once `v0.1.0` ships, japicmp locks `thinlet-core`'s public surface.
`AppletLauncher extends java.applet.Applet`; if it were in core, the eventual
removal of `java.applet.Applet` (JDK 26+) would break `thinlet-core`'s compile
with no exit but the divergence playbook — for a launcher almost nobody runs.
Moving it to `thinlet-demos` pre-`v0.1.0` keeps core's public surface
applet-free. `FrameLauncher` (extends `Frame`, durable indefinitely) is the
only launcher in `thinlet-core`.

## D7 — Trace tolerance model (the central cross-JDK guarantee)
**Date:** 2026-06-13

Pinned fonts fix the glyph source but **not** the JDK's pixel-metric math
(`FontMetrics.getAscent()`, `stringWidth()`, etc. can return different integers
across JDKs). The cross-JDK guarantee is therefore "behavior identical *within
a defined metric tolerance*," not "byte-identical." The trace diff is:

- **Structural-exact:** method-name and arg-type/arity sequence compared
  exactly — any new/missing/reordered call is a real regression.
- **Categorical-exact:** booleans, color components, strings, enums compared
  exactly.
- **Value-tolerant:** numeric coordinate/size args compared within a configured
  pixel tolerance (**default ±2 px**), per call signature in
  `trace-tolerance.json`, reviewed when added.
- **Hash-iteration ordering normalized** at the serializer for groups
  originating at known `Hashtable`-iteration call sites.
- Side metadata (call-sites, stack traces, timestamps) is a sidecar CI
  artifact, excluded from the diff. The same ±2 px discipline applies to
  `getPreferredSize` layout assertions in surefire.

## D8 — `thinlet.dtd` kept byte-verbatim
**Date:** 2026-06-13

`thinlet-core/src/main/resources/thinlet.dtd` is byte-identical to the 2005
archive (sha256 `fd1bc3ae4f422e3608adf18d1074775917f3fd5483f752375b6720bc63bf8bac`).
It is explicitly excluded from the Spotless XML target and from `*.dtd`
whitespace/EOL rules in `.editorconfig`, and marked `binary` in
`.gitattributes`. The "verbatim" claim is honored mechanically, not by promise.

## D9 — Test corpus vendored into `thinlet-core`
**Date:** 2026-06-13

The demo + draft XML corpus used by `thinlet-core`'s parser and trace tests is
vendored into `thinlet-core/src/test/resources/corpus/{demo,drafts,amazon}/`
rather than basedir-referenced from the sibling demos module. Keeps
`thinlet-core` standalone-buildable; the consumer-compat job needs no sibling
directory.

## D10 — `v0.0.1-bootstrap` is a git tag only
**Date:** 2026-06-13

`v0.0.1-bootstrap` is a plain annotated git tag marking the end of Phase 0
scaffolding. It is **never** published to Maven and **never** a japicmp
baseline. japicmp is configured but inactive during Phase 0 and activates from
`v0.1.0` onward (Phase 1), comparing against `v0.1.0`.
